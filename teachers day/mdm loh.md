## mdm loh ##
she is our **_hero_**!
she teaches us science and tells us stories about the world
chemistry _in the lab_ and chemistry of _love_
she always goes the extra mile to help anyone
the experiments in the lab are always fun
microscopes, osmosis, paper chromatography !
she makes every lesson interesting with a **bright** smile
and she helped my grades go **up**
her criticisms are _fair_ and _constructive_
she **never** leaves struggling ones behind
she inspires everyone to do their *best*
and encourages us with _donuts_
she is a star!
but not just any star, **_our_** star!
